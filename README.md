# Conditional-Mutex-Train-Simulator
A simulator of trains arriving to the station from east and west and crossing the bridge one at a time via mutex and conditional variables.
Starter code was provided in the train.h and train.c. 
I implemented the ArriveBridge, LeaveBridge, and CrossBridge in the final solution. 

Program accepts two parameters: first is required second is optional. first is integer of number of trains to simulate. second is filename of data to read from.
